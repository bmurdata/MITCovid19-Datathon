# About the MI COVID-19 Datathon

  The MIT COVID-19 Datathon is a week-long virtual event where teams of data scientists, clinicians, public health professionals and other subject matter experts come together to develop meaning insights leveraging existing datasets to influence policy and decision marking in the public and private sector.

   The overall goal of the project was to use existing data and provide insights on it. 
# Research Goals

   Track E was focused on Megacity Pandemic Response in NYC, as NYC was one of the first hot spots and presented a data rich environment.

   Our question was: Do neighborhood features such as population health and social interaction patterns have an impact on COVID-19 outcomes in NYC?
   
   We approached the problem from 2 perspectives:
   
   1. Is there a correlation between general community health patterns and COVID-19 outcomes?
   2. Is there a correlation between geographic mobility pattern and COVID-19 outcomes?
